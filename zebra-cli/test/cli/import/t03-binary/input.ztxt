zebra is a typed data format for storing arbitrary combinations of sums,
products and arrays in compressed form. It achieves high compression by
decomposing this data in to a "struct of arrays" representation on disk. zebra
stores data in blocks so that files can be streamed without loading the entire
file in memory.
