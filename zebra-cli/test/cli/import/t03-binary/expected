=== Data ===
zebra is a typed data format for storing arbitrary combinations of sums,
products and arrays in compressed form. It achieves high compression by
decomposing this data in to a "struct of arrays" representation on disk. zebra
stores data in blocks so that files can be streamed without loading the entire
file in memory.

=== Summary ===
block_count        = 1
row_count          = 319
max_rows_per_block = 319
first_key          = <file is not a map>
last_key           = <file is not a map>
